Task 1: The Domain Extractor (Slicing & Strings)

Scenario: You have a list of web URLs.

Goal: Create a script that takes the URL `https://api.github.com/v3` and uses **slicing** or `.split()` to extract just the domain name (`github.com`).

DevOps Value: Parsing logs to see which external services your app is calling.

Instructions:
1. Start with the URL: https://api.github.com/v3
2. Use string methods (slicing or .split()) to extract only "github.com"
3. Print the extracted domain name
